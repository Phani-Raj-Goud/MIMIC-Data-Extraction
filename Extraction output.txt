Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We 
also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your ___ Team.

History of Present Illness:
___ male with ___ disease, dyslipidemia, and a
history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred
to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and
visual hallucinations. 

The following history is taken from chart review: 

The patient was seen by his neurologist on ___ at which time he
was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait
freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by
0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He
successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but
began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his
neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. 
Despite
the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted
progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.
This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the
bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on
___ was reassuring. 

On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to
experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his
backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the
couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.
The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the
patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24
hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his
own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who
recommended presentation to the ED. 

In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and
SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper
extremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a
negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no 
EKG
changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. 
Chest
Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was
evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for
failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,
and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his
home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  

On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He 
is
not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is 
in
the hospital and that it is ___. He is not sure why he is here
and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor
cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he
mentions that he has not had a fall for ___ years. He denies any
fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, or dysuria.

IMAGING
=============

CXR ___: 
IMPRESSION:

prevertebral soft tissue swelling or soft tissue mass in the 
neck. 
 

EGD: ___
 Impression: Hiatal hernia
Angioectasia in the stomach
Angioectasia in the duodenum
 (biopsy, biopsy)

- follow-up with Dr. ___ if biopsies show eosinophilic 
esophagitis 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of GERD who presents with 
subacute worsening of dysphagia and foreign body sensation. This

prominent esophagus but was otherwise normal. She was evaluated 
by Gastroenterology and underwent an upper endoscopy on ___. 
This showed a normal appearing esophagus. Biopsies were taken. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-f/u biopsies from EGD
-if results show eosinophilic esophagitis, follow-up with Dr. ___. 
___ for management
-pt should undergo barium swallow as an outpatient for further 
workup of her dysphagia

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of factor VIII deficiency who 
presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. 
The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of 
consciousness on ___. He was initially seen at 
___ where CT imaging of head/neck showed no 
intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right 
platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active 
contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also 
developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain 
films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by ___ 
Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII 
assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his 
hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on ___ to 11.6 on ___. 
Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The 
patient saw his hematologist on ___ and was found to have a 
hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the 
patient followed up with his PCP ___ ___ at which time his 
hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank 
hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal 
bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally 
intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or 
palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of 
the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ___ 
resting, ___ moving), though this has improved over the course 
of the week.  
In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA. 
Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was 
9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 
103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage 
along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary 
read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was 
contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 
0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher 
management.  
Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant 
bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. 
Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. 
He was tested and found to have ___ disease. Later, 
after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late 
(e.g. ___ days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The 
patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the 
___ and was diagnosed 
with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on 
multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as 
low as ~50.  
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without 
complaint.

distinguish musculature from hemorrhage. No active extravasation 
seen. Probable old hematoma along posterior left flank. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of mild FVIII deficiency who 
presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and 
falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding.

# FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY, MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented 
after recent snowboarding accident. At ___ 
___, imaging was notable for neck and shoulder hematomas. 
Upon reevaluation by his PCP, the patient was found to have a 
flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin, there was concern for 
retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over 
his flank musculature, but no active extravasation. He was given 
IV DDAVP, but FVIII activity was 103 (wnl). CBC remained stable 
and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius 
hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin 
monitoring, but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given 
normal FVIII level.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with bruising on your right 
side and low blood counts after a snowboarding fall. With your 
history of hemophilia, it was important to evaluate internal 
bleeding which did show a right muscular flank blood collection. 
Your facotr VIII level was 103 and you received IV DDAVP under 
our care. Your blood counts were stable to improved on the day 
of admission. 

It is important that you not participate in any dangerous 
activities given your recent bleed and your hemophilia. Bleeding 
in hemophiliacs has more potential to be life-threatening.

Please get your blood counts checked at ___ site on either 
___ or ___. Follow up with your 
regular doctor early next week.

Best wishes,
Your ___ Care Team
